*                        README for PHP Samples
*
* The <install path>\sqllib\samples\php directory contains this README file
* where <install_path> is the location of DB2 9 on your hard drive. The
* default location for <install_path> is C:\Program Files\IBM on Windows and
* $HOME on unix
*
* This README describes how to run PHP sample code for DB2 9.
* The DB2 9 sample code and build files for PHP are located
* in the following directory:
*
*  Windows:
*    <install_path>\sqllib\samples\php
*  Unix:
*    <install_path>/sqllib/samples/php
*
* Copy the sample files from this directory to a working directory prior to
* running the sample programs. The sample program directories are typically
* read-only on most platforms and some samples produce output files that
* require write perimssions on the directory.
*
* WARNING: Some of these samples may change your database or database manager
*          configuration.  Execute the samples against a test database
*          only, such as the DB2 SAMPLE database.
*
******************************************************************************
*
*               Prepare your DB2 sample development environment
*
*   On Windows all samples should be run and built in a DB2 Command Window.
*   The DB2 Command Window is needed to execute the db2 specific commands.
*   Listed below is how to opening the DB2 Command Window:
*
*   o From the Start Menu click Start --> Programs --> IBM DB2 -->
*    <DB2 copy name> --> Command Line Tools --> Command Window
*
*  1) Copy the files in <install path>sqllib\samples\php\* (windows),
*     <install path>sqllib/samples/php/* (unix) to a working directory and
*     ensure that directory has write permission.
*
*  2) Start the Database Manager with the following command:
*       db2start
*
*  3) Create the sample database with the following command:
*       db2sampl -v8
*
*  4) Test that you can connect to the database with the following command:
*       db2 connect to sample
*
*  5) cd to the directory containing the files copied in Step 1.

*                         PHP Samples Design
*
* The PHP sample programs form an object-based design reflecting the
* component nature of DB2. Related samples demonstrate a specific level of
* database programming. Each level is identified by the first two characters
* of the sample name. Here are the database levels represented by the
* samples:
*
* Identifier     DB2 Level
*
*     db        Database Level.
*     tb        Table Level.
*     dt        Data Type Level.
*     ud        User-defined function client program.
*
