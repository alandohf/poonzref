*             README for Command Line Processor XML Samples
*
* The "<install_path>/sqllib/samples/xml/clp" directory on Unix and
* "<install_path>\sqllib\samples\xml\clp" directory on Windows
* contains this README file.
*             where <install_path> is the location of DB2 9 on your
*             hard drive.
* The default location for <install_path> is
*             C:\Program Files\IBM on Windows,
*             $HOME on Unix.
*
* This README describes how to run CLP XML sample code for DB2 9. The
* DB2 9 sample code for CLP XML is located in the following directory:
*       <install_path>\sqllib\samples\xml\clp for Windows and
*       <install_path>/sqllib/samples/xml/clp for Unix
*
* It is recommended that you copy the sample files from this directory
* to a working directory prior to building  the sample programs.
* The sample program directories are typically read-only on most
* platforms and some samples produce output files that require write
* perimssions on the directory.
*
* WARNING:
* 1. Some of these samples may change your database or database manager
*    configuration. Execute the samples against a test database
*    only, such as SAMPLE database.
* 2. XML data can only be stored in single-partition databases defined with
*    the UTF-8 code set.  Note that using XML features prevents future use of
*    the Database Partitioning Feature available with DB2 Enterprise Server
*    Edition for Linux, Unix, and Windows.
*
******************************************************************************
*
*        Prepare your DB2 sample development environment for Windows/Unix
*
* 1) Copy the files in <install_path>\sqllib\samples\xml\clp\* for Windows
*    and $HOME/sqllib/samples/xml/clp/* for Unix to a working directory
*    and ensure that directory has write permission.
*
* 2) On Windows platform, all samples should be run and built in DB2
*    Command Window.
*    The DB2 command window is needed to execute the db2 specific commands.
*    You can follow the step below to open DB2 command window.
*      From the Start Menu click Start --> Programs --> IBM DB2 -->
*      <DB2 copy name> --> Command Line Tools --> Command Window.
*
* 3) Start the database manager with the following command:
*      db2start
*
* 4) Create the sample database with the following command:
*      db2sampl -xml
*
* 5) Connect to the sample database with the following command:
*      db2 connect to sample
*
* 6) To build stored procedures and User defined functions,
*    ensure that you have write permission on the
*    <install_path>\sqllib\function directory on Windows and
*    <install_path>/sqllib/function directory on Unix.
*
* 7) Change directory (CD) to the directory containing the files
*    copied in step 1.
*
******************************************************************************
*
*                     *** Executing CLP Samples ***
*
* Use following command to execute CLP samples:
*   db2 -vf <filename> -t
*           <filename> -- Name of the Command Line Processor file (including
*                         the extension).
*
* NOTE :
*
*    1. Some of the samples might need one or more data files at runtime.
*       some of the samples may also need setup script to be run before
*       running the sample.See the specific sample descriptions in
*       "File Descriptions" section for more details.
*
*    2. Refer to the "File Descriptions" section in this README for
*       information  on specific samples and any special considerations
*       relevant for each. The HEADER sections of these samples also provide
*       further details on each sample.
