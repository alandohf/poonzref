This directory contains sample command files that demonstrate XML
Extender administration, stored procedures and functions.  These command
files are referred to in the Getting Started chapter of the XML Extender
Administration and Programming book.
   
Before proceeding, you must set the following DB2 registry variables for
some of the XML Extender UDFs to execute properly:
   DB2_DXX_PATHS_ALLOWED_READ
   DB2_DXX_PATHS_ALLOWED_WRITE

These sample files use the default DB2 installation directory for your platform.
If you installed DB2 to a different directory, change the directory in the 
sample files to match your system. You can find the default DB2 installation 
directories in the following topics of the DB2 Information Center:

"Installing DB2 Servers (Linux and UNIX)"

"Installing DB2 Servers (Windows)"
